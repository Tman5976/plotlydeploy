This assignment tested our ability to design a webpage that could communicate data from the samples.json data.

Our challenge was to create three different charts to make the relevant data easy to find and understand.

The charts include:
- A bar chart showcasing the ten most prevalent bacteria found in the sample.
- A bubble chart containing all the bacteria found in a sample.
- A gauge chart showing the frequency the individual washed their belly button.

There is also a panel describing the demographic of the individual test subject and an option to select a specific test subject.

After the charts were created on the page, we began to add different design elements to the page. I added an image to the jumbotron section of the webpage and customized the font color and style to be easier to read.

I added a background to the entire page and changed the fonts on the individual charts.
